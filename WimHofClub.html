    <h1>NATURAL WAYS TO BOOST YOUR ENERGY LEVEL</h1>
    <p>When you are feeling low on energy, you can raise your energy level by taking away the underlying causes. Depending on the cause, there are many things that you can try to naturally boost your energy level.

        You are dehydrated. Scientists have found that people that don’t drink for long periods of time are twice as tired compared to people that are properly hydrated. Making sure that you drink enough water can help you get through the day.
        
        You don’t eat properly. When you eat properly, your body will reward you with more energy. Avoid processed foodstuffs and those high in sugar. This will prevent an energy dip later on.
        
        You are stressed out all the time. Stress will bring you body in a state of fight or flight. This consumes large amounts of energy. Furthermore, stress hormones can bring your body rhythm out of balance and have a negative impact on your sleep. Therefore, chronic stress can be detrimental for your energy level. Proper stress management is key to avoid negative effects from stress.
        
        You don’t get enough quality sleep. Most of us don’t get the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep a day. On the other hand, more sleep doesn’t always have to be better for your energy level. When your sleep cycles are constantly interrupted, you can wake up more tired than before you fell asleep. A healthy diet and low levels of stress can do wonders for your quality of sleep.
        
        You don’t exercise. Nowadays, many people are living sedentary lives. We sit at work, we sit in traffic, and we sit on the couch when we are at home. Research has provided us with evidence that people that get 75 tot 150 minutes of exercise each week, experience more energy than those who don’t. But don’t overdo it— overtraining can have a detrimental effect on your energy balance.</p>

    <h1>WAYS TO BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM NATURALLY</h1>
    <p>If you want to strengthen you immune response, there are a number of different ways to naturally boost your immune system. For example, a strong immune response is related to a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, certain vitamins, and certain hormones. Below are some tips that can help you boost your immune system in a natural manner.

        Ensure that you get enough sleep. With the help of scientific research, evidence was found that well-rested people are less likely to catch an illness. For instance, people that slept the recommended seven to nine hours a night responded better to flu vaccine compared to a control group.
        
        Follow a healthy diet. A diet that is low in processed foods and sugar is related to a healthier immune system.
        
        Exercise regularly. Exercising is considered to be an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Getting enough exercise lowers your blood pressure, balances your body weight, and improves your cardiovascular health.
        
        Avoid chronic stress. Stress hormones suppress your immune system. Therefore, being under emotional stress for a prolonged period of time should be avoided.
        
        Vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D are related to a higher susceptibility to infection and autoimmune diseases. Our body produces vitamin D via exposure to sunlight. Supplementing vitamin D is advised in autumn and winter, when relatively little sunshine reaches our skin.
        
        Supply good bacteria. Many important processes that are related to your immune system take place in your gut. By consuming probiotic foods, you can stimulate the digestion of nutrients that support your immune system.</p>
